# An Analysis of Kickstarter Campaigns
### Project Overview
This project investigated the results of several different crowdfunded campaigns from different countries and various genres, noting trends in success rates based on campaign monetary goals and launch date. The investigation of this data set focused on the outcomes specifc to theatre kickstarters to provide conclusions that might provide insight into recommendations for future campaigns in this category.

### Analysis
#### Outcomes by goal
When analyzing the theatre campaigns by monetary goal, ranges were created to determine success rates. Lower bound range focused on campaigns with a goal of less than $1000, while the largest range looked at campaigns with goals over $50,000. The ranges between these were $5000 increments. The visual below shows that campaigns with monetary goals less than $1000 had the highest success rates. While success rates declined in successive ranges, they remained above 50% until $20,000, where campaigns tended to fail at higher rates than they did succeed. There are two data points on the graph that may make the visual seem misleading. It should be worth noting that the data for these ranges represented less than 1% of total theatre campaigns, but was heavily represented on the graph.

#### Outcomes by launch date
Success rates were also analyzed to determine any trends in the date(month) the campaign was launched. There were no significant trends in the campaigns getting canceled based on their launch date. When looking at failed and successful campaigns, the linear data seem to follow similar slopes from month to month, with two notable deviations. First, the success rates of campaigns launched in May was considerably higher than any other month. Oppositely, December shows a considerable drop to the lowest overall success rate, where it is nearly equal to failure rate.

#### Limitations and thoughts for further analysis
While it is interesting to note global trends for this (or any other category), it seems worth considering further analysis of the data set by country, including the intersectional analysis of success rates based on launch date and monetary goal. This information could provide more targeted insight for future campaigns depending where they are in the world.
